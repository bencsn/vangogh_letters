Paris 16 August

Dear Vincent,
We received your letter for Cor and gave it to him this morning because he arrived here very early, at 6 o’clock.1 We’re so pleased that he was able to break his journey to Southampton in Paris — in all likelihood he’ll be away for a long time, and Theo, in particular, would have been very sorry if he hadn’t seen him again. We started 
 1v:2  showing him the city straightaway this morning, from place de l’Etoile to place de la Bastille, and he was thrilled with it.2
Theo was a bit disappointed that there wasn’t a note for him in it — do write to him soon — even if it’s just one little word — we’re so longing to hear how you are from you yourself, and hope so sincerely that you’ll soon feel better again. You don’t know how often 
 1v:3  you are thought about and spoken of. Ma wrote, too, that she was longing for another letter from you — do you know what Cor brought me from her this morning? — a pair of the sweetest little socks for our little boy (for I still insist that it will be a little boy — even if you mock me for it!).
Do let Theo hear something from you soon if you can — he so longs for it. A warm handshake in thought from

Your loving
Jo

Happily, Theo is well again.
